XMLTV grabber for vodafone.pt television service

All urls/api taken from https://tvnetvoz.vodafone.pt/sempre-consigo/guia-tv
the service is very fast and reliable, much better than the very weak
NOS page and more stable than MEO webservice

Sadly vodafone didn't help in any way, even after several attempts to have
then cooperate with me. The tv info is public, so this is safe for personal
usage.

For now, shell script version, i will later port this to perl and submit
to the xmltv project. The script only supports downloading one day, i
will have to expand it to support ranges and offsets.

I have been using this in the last few weeks and it is working fine here,
if you find any problem, contact me or open a ticket

To use, just run:

  tv_grab_pt_vdf.sh

to get the today xmltv... or run

  tv_grab_pt_vdf.sh 1

to get tomorrow xmltv data

Have fun
